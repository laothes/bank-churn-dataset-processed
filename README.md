R code for Binary Classification with a Bank Churn Dataset in kaggle.
Address: [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e1/]
The code consists of the following 7 parts:
1. EDA
  NA values
  duplicate values
  correlation matrix
  The density of multiple continued variables with category
  The percentage of being exited or not for discrete variables
  Distribution of Number of Products with Exited or not
2. split dataset
3. normalize the numerical columns
  normalize ('Age','CreditScore', 'Balance','EstimatedSalary')
  tf-idf the surname (this part will take 2-3 hours, please reload processed data)
4. feature engineering
5. Models (default and adjusted)
  logistic regression
  random forest
  XGBoost
6. submission
7. adjusting process (xgboost part will take about one day to run)

Note
1. The code can run fully, but it is not recommended. We suggest using the function 'tfidf_score' as a cut-off point.
	You should run the code up to the cut-off point and then skip the portion that processes the dataset using the function. Instead, reload the preprocessed data that we have provided.
	Since we have set a seed during dataset splitting, the preprocessed data will be identical to the results generated by the code execution.
2. The performance of the Random Forest model is surprising due to the dataset segmentation. However, the cross-validation (CV) results during parameter tuning are within the expected range.
